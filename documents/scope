The development of a multicellular organism from a zygote is enacted by a orchestrated cellular process involving divisions, transformations, migration and pattern/tissue formation. 
Single-cell technologies probe the developmental process at a cellular level. A comparative analysis of single-cell data enables a better understanding on .
